Welcome to the Arduino Learning Lab! This repository is dedicated to sharing Arduino projects that cover a wide range of topics from basic digital input/output to complex sensor integrations. Whether you're a beginner just starting out with microcontrollers, or an experienced maker looking to experiment with new sensors, you'll find something of interest here.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need:
- An Arduino board (Uno, Mega, Leonardo, etc.)
- Assorted sensors depending on the project (details provided in each project folder)
- Arduino IDE for uploading code to the Arduino board

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ArduinoLearningLab.git`
2. Open the Arduino IDE, and navigate to the project you want to work on.
3. Open the `.ino` file for the project.
4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
5. Select the correct board type and port in the Arduino IDE.
6. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
